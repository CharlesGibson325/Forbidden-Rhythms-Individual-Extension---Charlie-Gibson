## Changelist

* Added a Seagull enemy that spaws at 30 seconds in. Will attempt to throw eggs at the player that explode on collisions.
* Added Platforms. Can spawn on their own or with other obstacles underneath them. The player can land, run and jump on these platforms.
* Overhauled Level Generation System. The level now is endless, and generates randomly as you run. Objects in the level are destroyed after moving off screen.
* More dynamic movement. The player can now move left and right (A & D), at different speeds to keep the feel of running forward. Additionally the player can now jump highr or lower based on how long the SPACE bar is held. 
* A lives system. The player now spawns with 3 lives, and the level ends when they run out of lives. Hitting obstacles or being hit by the seagulls egg damage the player.
* Distance/Time tracker. The level now tracks time and distance travelled and displays these scores after the player loses. Time is also actively shown while playing the level.

## Known Bugs

*The level generation sometimes generates multiple obstacles at the start of the level. Does not stop the game running or working just looks a bit weird.
