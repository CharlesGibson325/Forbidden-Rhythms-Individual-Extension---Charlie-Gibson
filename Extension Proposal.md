## Title of Extension

Forbidden Rhythm: Run Forever.

## Brief Overview of game 

Extending the Runner Level within the game, I will expand the project to make this level more fun, replayable and challenging. I will be adding more elements to the level for the player to interact with such as enemies or other obstacles. I will redo the level generation system to accomadate for an endless running experience, and change the players movement to be more dynamic and useable. I will also fix some minor bugs caused within the game, for example explosion texture not loading properly when kicking a box. I also aim to add an enemy to the level for more challenge later on.

## Must Have Features

* **Endless Running Level** Random level generation that spawns as the player runs, and is destroyed when moved passed and off screen.
* **Overhauled Movement** A proper gravity system, left and right movement and jumping with varied height depending on the duration the jump button is held.
* **A life system** A system so the level ends when the player runs out of lives (probably 3)
* **General Bug Fixes/Backwards Compatibilty** Fixing some already pre-existing bugs and ensuring that non of the players new movement mechanics affect non-relevant levels.


## Should Have Features

* **Unique character powers** An additional obstacle, the platform. The player should be able to land on and run across these obstacles, falling or jumping off the end of them.
* **Enemy Character** A seagull enemy which spawns in later in the level, and will fly around dropping explosive eggs on the player in an attempt to end their run.

## Could Have Features

* **2 Player Mode** A pvp mode, where the level is displayed twice, along the top and bottom of the screen, and the 2 players compete to see who can make it further. 
* **More Hazards** Additional obstacles, such as bounce pads and swinging weapons, to give the player more to avoid.
* **Leaderboards** Storing results from the runner mode to file and reading them in so that future players can place themselves on the leaderboard and compare distances/times.

## Wish to Have Features

* **Boss Enemy** A much more powerful dangerous enemy that spawns at certain distances into the run. With multiple attacks the player would have to avoid.
* **Custom Game Mode** Options for the player to toggle the spawning of individual components such as obstacles, enemies, platforms etc.
